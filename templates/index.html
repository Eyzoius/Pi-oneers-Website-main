                    Starting out as an informal, small, and campus-based peer tutorial service among batchmates, the earliest form of the organization was founded by several scholars of Philippine Science High School â€“ Cagayan Valley Campus (PSHS â€“ CVC). It was only after months of peer tutoring when co-founders Edrian Paul Liao, Joanne Micaela Dizo, John Vincent Albino, Arianne May Bacolod, Alexandra Gabrielle Lee, and Gabrielle Rose Abad decided to take the budding organization to the next level. This bold step was a product of their passion for STEM, its quality, and its accessibilityâ€”a passion that is shared and nurtured within and outside Ï€-oneers.

                        Reflected by our mantra and interests, the flagship project of Ï€-oneers is our free peer tutoring program. This program consists of volunteer-led sessions offering academic help in secondary-level mathematics, biology, chemistry, and physics. Our volunteer teachers, who are also high schoolers, are united in their willingness and passion for helping fellow students navigate the roads, seas, and airs of STEM subjects.
